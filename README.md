### Documentation

### **Branching Strategy**

For all projects, I will use a **single branch strategy** where all work is conducted on the `main` branch. The workflow will be streamlined to ensure stability while minimizing complexity.

### **Main Branch (`main`)**

- The `main` branch will be the **sole branch** used for development and deployment of my work.
 
- All code changes, feature additions, bug fixes, and updates will be made directly on the `main` branch.

- Each change will be thoroughly tested before being committed to ensure the stability of the branch.
  
### **Workflow**

- Instead of managing multiple branches, I will focus on keeping the `main` branch **stable** and **up-to-date**.

- Features will be developed directly on the `main` branch with regular commits.

- Before committing any changes, I will run **unit tests** and **integration tests** to verify that the new code does not introduce bugs or instability.

 -Code reviews will be performed before pushing changes to the `main` branch.

This streamlined strategy simplifies the development process while maintaining the stability of the codebase. It also reduces the overhead of managing multiple branches.


###### Use of .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file is used to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git. This helps to keep the repository clean and ensures that sensitive or unnecessary files are not committed. Each project will have a `.gitignore` file that includes the following:

1. **Sensitive Information**: Exclude files that contain credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information.
2. **Build Artifacts**: Ignore compiled code, build directories, and other temporary files generated during the build process.
3. **Dependency Directories**: Exclude directories used by package managers (e.g., `node_modules` for Node.js, `venv` for Python).
4. **System Files**: Ignore system-specific files such as `.DS_Store` (macOS) and `Thumbs.db` (Windows).
